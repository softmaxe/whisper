// quiet call, which is what made openwhispr#1990 invisible mid-meeting.
//
// Two triggers are trusted enough to restart capture:
//
//   delivery: no chunk at all for STALL_MS. Only meaningful where the platform
//     guarantees a chunk per period (the macOS tap); the loopback helpers may
//     legitimately go idle, so the caller opts in via watchesDelivery.
//   device: the helper reported that the device it was pinned to changed or
//     went away. Decisive, and faster than waiting for the stall window.
//
// Going quiet is reported but never restarts anything, because restarting a
// working capture costs real audio and a silent call is not a fault.
//
// Tick-driven like meetingAutoEndController: every input updates state and the
// owner calls tick() on an interval, so there is no timer to leak per session.
