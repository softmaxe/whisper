/**
 * The OpenWhispr Assistant illustration on the assistant-hotkey step.
 *
 * A single exported image rather than a DOM composition: the artwork (grass
 * backdrop, prompt bubble, mail window, dictation pill) ships as one 2x export,
 * so it matches Figma exactly and cannot drift.
 *
 * Tradeoff, deliberately accepted: the copy inside the mock-up is pixels now, so
 * it stays English in every locale. It is illustrative chrome, not UI the user
 * reads for meaning.
 *
 * This stays above the shortcut controls and outside the shrinking flex pool.
 * The frame is a fixed band rather than the export's 16:9 (at full height the
 * step scrolled) and crops a lightly enlarged image biased toward the top, so
 * the spoken request and mail window stay in view with no export edge showing.
